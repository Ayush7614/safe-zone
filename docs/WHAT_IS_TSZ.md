# What is TSZ (Thyris Safe Zone)?

TSZ (Thyris Safe Zone) is an **AI‑powered guardrails and data security gateway** built by **Thyris.AI**. It is designed to protect sensitive information while enabling organizations to safely adopt Generative AI, LLMs and third‑party APIs.

At its core, TSZ acts as a **zero‑trust, policy enforcement layer** that sits between your applications and external systems. Every request or response that crosses this boundary can be inspected, redacted, blocked or enriched according to your security and compliance policies.

## 1. Why TSZ Exists

Modern AI and API‑driven systems introduce new classes of risk:

- **PII and secrets leakage** through prompts, logs or model outputs
- **Prompt injection and jailbreak attacks** targeting LLM pipelines
- **Toxic or non‑compliant outputs** (hate speech, medical/financial advice, regulatory violations)
- **Unstructured, invalid responses** that break downstream systems (JSON that isn’t JSON, missing fields, wrong types)

Traditional security controls (WAFs, regex filters, static DLP tools) are not sufficient on their own. They either:

- Miss context‑dependent risks, or
- Generate too many false positives, or
- Cannot understand AI‑generated content.

TSZ addresses this gap with a **hybrid engine**:

1. **Deterministic rules** (high‑performance regex patterns, allowlists, blocklists)
2. **AI‑powered semantic analysis** (LLM‑backed validators and guardrails)
3. **Structured format enforcement** (JSON schema / format validation)

## 2. Key Capabilities

### 2.1 PII & Secrets Detection

TSZ detects and classifies sensitive entities such as:

- Email addresses, phone numbers, names
- Credit card numbers, bank details
- API keys, access tokens, secrets
- Organization‑specific or domain‑specific identifiers

Each detection receives a **confidence score** and an **explanation** describing how the score was derived (regex vs AI, thresholds, etc.).

### 2.2 Redaction & Masking

Before data leaves your environment, TSZ can **redact** sensitive values using placeholders, while preserving context for downstream systems (especially LLMs):

- `john.doe@company.com` → `[EMAIL]`
- `4111 1111 1111 1111` → `[CREDIT_CARD]`

This allows you to:

- Keep conversations meaningful for LLMs
- Prevent raw PII or secrets from ever reaching external providers

### 2.3 AI‑Powered Guardrails

TSZ integrates with AI models to perform semantic checks that go beyond keywords, for example:

- Toxic / abusive language
- Financial or medical advice
- Brand safety and tone of voice
- Domain‑specific safety rules (e.g. “no competitor mentions”)

Policies are expressed as **validators** that can be:

- **BUILTIN** (predefined rules)
- **REGEX** (pattern‑based)
- **SCHEMA** (JSON/XML schema validation)
- **AI_PROMPT** (LLM‑backed guardrail with a prompt)

### 2.4 Structured Response Enforcement

For AI applications that expect structured outputs (JSON, typed objects, etc.), TSZ can validate that responses conform to a pre‑defined format before they reach your application.

This prevents:

- Application crashes due to invalid JSON
- Silent failures caused by missing or wrongly typed fields

### 2.5 Templates & Reusable Policies

TSZ supports **guardrail templates** – portable bundles of patterns and validators that can be imported with a single API call. Example templates:

- PII Starter Pack
- Compliance Pack (PCI/GDPR)
- AI Safety Pack (toxicity, unsafe content)

Templates make it easy to:

- Share policies across teams and environments
- Bootstrap a new deployment within minutes

## 3. How TSZ Fits in Your Architecture

TSZ is typically deployed as a **microservice** inside your VPC or private network:

1. Your application sends incoming user input or outgoing AI responses to TSZ via the `/detect` API.
2. TSZ runs:
   - Fast pattern checks (regex, allowlist/blocklist)
   - Optional AI guardrails (toxicity, safety, domain rules)
   - Optional structure/format validation
3. TSZ returns:
   - Redacted text
   - Detection metadata and breakdown
   - Guardrail results
   - A `blocked` flag and an optional human‑readable `message`

Your application then decides how to proceed:

- If `blocked = true` → reject the operation or ask the user to revise content.
- If `blocked = false` → use `redacted_text` to call an LLM or external API.

## 4. Who Uses TSZ?

TSZ is designed for organizations that:

- Handle **regulated data** (financial, healthcare, education, government)
- Require strong **data residency** and **data minimization** guarantees
- Need to integrate **LLMs securely** into existing applications
- Want to standardize guardrails across multiple teams and products

Common use cases:

- Secure prompt and response filtering for LLM chatbots
- Pre‑processing and redaction of logs or customer support tickets
- Centralized guardrail layer for multiple AI applications
- Compliance enforcement for content generation pipelines

## 5. Next Steps

If you are new to TSZ, we recommend the following path:

1. **Read the Quick Start** – `QUICK_START.md` to run TSZ locally with Docker.
2. **Explore the API** – import `TSZ_Postman_Collection.json` and call `/detect`.
3. **Review the Architecture & Security Overview** – `ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md` for a deeper technical view.
4. **Integrate with your stack** – follow `API_REFERENCE.md` for production integration details.

For a high‑level, executive‑oriented overview, see `../PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`.
